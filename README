Build Process
=============
Traditionally, you converted your LaTeX source file to a DVI file, which could
then be  converted to PostScript with dvips.  This, in turn, can be converted
to a PDF file by ps2pdf:

                  latex             dvips            ps2pdf
        text.tex -------> text.dvi -------> text.ps --------> text.pdf

This requires all the graphics to be EPS files. But that's not a major problem,
as raster graphics can be converted to EPS.  Furthermore, the scalability of
vector graphics means clean-looking figures at all resolutions.  And vector PS
is usually very compact.

But what about using photographs, which are usually saved as JPEGs?  This
really isn't a problem, because the jpeg2ps command (from Debian's jpeg2ps
package) wraps JPEG images in an EPS header.
