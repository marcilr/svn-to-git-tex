Build Process
=============
Traditionally, you converted your LaTeX source file to a DVI file, which could
then be  converted to PostScript with dvips.  This, in turn, can be converted
to a PDF file by ps2pdf:

                  latex             dvips            ps2pdf
        text.tex -------> text.dvi -------> text.ps --------> text.pdf

This requires all the graphics to be EPS files. But that's not a major problem,
as raster graphics can be converted to EPS.  Furthermore, the scalability of
vector graphics means clean-looking figures at all resolutions.  And vector PS
is usually very compact.

But what about using photographs, which are usually saved as JPEGs?  This
really isn't a problem, because the jpeg2ps command (from Debian's jpeg2ps
package) wraps JPEG images in an EPS header.

build.xml
  Ant build.xml to compile LaTeX file crafted by Jason Kattell at
  DNR LRIS BPU.  He used the ant apply task to make it a bit more
  abstract.  Cool stuff.

clean.bat
  Remove dynamically created files from build process.
  Analogous to 'make clean' target.

cygwin.txt
  Build notes for LaTeX using cygwin.

  Documenation

links.txt
  Subvertion to git conversion related links

make.bat
  Build PDF from LaTeX source

Makefile
  Standard GNU makefile to build LaTeX document.
